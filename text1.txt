There are two of us in the room: my dog ​​and me.
Outside, a terrible, violent storm howls.
The dog is in front of me - and looks me straight in the eyes.
And I also look into the eyes.
She seems to want to tell me something.
She is mute, she is without words, she does not understand herself - but I understand her.
I understand that in this moment the same feeling lives in her and in me
that there is no difference between us.
We are solemn: in each of us it burns and glows
quivering spark.
Death will fly in, wave its cold wing at him ...
And the end!
who will then understand
that it was in each of us that a light burned?
Not! It's not an animal or a person
changing views...
these are two pairs of loving eyes directed
Each other?
And in each of these pairs,
in the animal and in man, one and the same life presses timidly against the other.
